# CSC212 - Review/Gradebook Project

## Summary



## Planning

#### Tentative Plan
    1. Write pseudocode for main, as well as gradebook .cpp & .h, upload as their own files in /pseudocode
    2. Pick which functions you want to implement via the "Functions" file in /pseudocode
    3. Implement functions individually, updating the real files in /final_files
    4. Functions can be tested along the way with the input1.txt file in /pseudocode
    5. Each member writes a full mock data set (~20 students), following the example dataset in the input_format.txt file
    6. Complete summary, as well as the compilation/runtime sections in README
    7. Provide ample comments in all files
    8. Make project walkthrough video
    9. Upload to Gradescope by Monday Feb. 27th

#### Pseudocode
All pseudocode used to map out the project is kept within the "pseudocode" folder. Pseudocode was written, and then it turned into real, usable code within the project files. Also within the pseudocode folder is the .md file "Functions", where all the needed functions for the program are listed out, and each teammate responsible for implementing a certain function lists their name above it


## Instructions
