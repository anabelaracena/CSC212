All input files should follow this same format
First line is all the student names, only separated by whitespaces
Every subsequent row contains all the grades for each student
For example, Student 2's grades will all be on the 2nd row after the name row
Grades should also all be grouped by category, i.e. labs, assignments, projects, exam
Grades should have a leading character indicating what category they're from (l = lab, a = assignment, p = project, e = exam)
Grades are their out of their point totals as listed in the syllabus, i.e no lab grade should be higher than 20pts, no assignment grade above 50pts, etc
In terms of how many grades there should be, there can be as little as 0, but shouldn't exceed the max set by the syllabus (10 Labs, 4 Assignments, 2 Projects, 1 Exam = 17 total grades)
See input1.txt for an example using our names with mock grades
